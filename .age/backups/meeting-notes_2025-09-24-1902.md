## Agenda

## Discussion

John mentioned that we should consider the new design approach. Sarah agreed but had concerns about the timeline. We discussed various options for about 20 minutes. There were several good points raised about user experience and technical feasibility.

Mike brought up some implementation details that I hadn't considered. We went back and forth on the database schema changes needed.

## Action Items
