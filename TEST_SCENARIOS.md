# Age CLI Test Scenarios

## Overview

This document defines specific test cases for validating Age CLI functionality. Each scenario includes sample input files, expected outputs, and validation criteria.

## Test Data Setup

# Team Meeting - Website Redesign

## Agenda
- Review current progress
- Discuss new design approach
- Plan next sprint

## Discussion

John mentioned that we should consider the new design approach. Sarah agreed but had concerns about the timeline. We discussed various options for about 20 minutes. There were several good points raised about user experience and technical feasibility.

Mike brought up some implementation details that I hadn't considered. We went back and forth on the database schema changes needed.

## Action Items
- [ ] John: Create mockups for new design
- [ ] Sarah: Review timeline and dependencies
- [ ] Mike: Research database migration approach
- [x] Evan: Schedule follow-up meeting

## Notes
Personal reminder: Need to follow up with the client about their feedback on colors.

# Transformer Architecture Analysis

## Summary

This paper introduces the Transformer architecture which has revolutionized natural language processing. The key innovation is the self-attention mechanism that allows the model to weigh the importance of different parts of the input sequence.

## Key Findings

The attention mechanism computes a weighted average of all positions in the sequence, allowing the model to access information from any part of the input. This is more efficient than recurrent approaches.

### Technical Details

The multi-head attention allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces at different positions.

Formula: Attention(Q,K,V) = softmax(QK^T/‚àöd_k)V

## Applications

- Machine translation
- Text summarization
- Question answering
- Code generation

## Personal Notes

This seems really applicable to our current project. Should discuss with the team whether we want to implement something similar for document summarization.

Need to read the follow-up papers on BERT and GPT.

# Implement User Authentication

## Requirements
- OAuth integration with Google/Apple
- Secure token storage
- Password reset flow
- Multi-device support

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Basic Auth
1. Set up OAuth providers
2. Implement login/logout flows
3. Add token management

### Phase 2: Security
1. Add biometric authentication
2. Implement secure storage
3. Add session management

## Technical Notes

Using Firebase Auth for the backend. Need to configure the OAuth providers in the console.

```javascript
// Example implementation
const auth = getAuth();
signInWithPopup(auth, provider)
  .then((result) => {
    const user = result.user;
    // Handle successful login
  });
```

## Blockers
- Waiting for design mockups
- Need API keys from client

## Progress
- [x] Research authentication libraries
- [x] Set up development environment
- [ ] Implement OAuth flows
- [ ] Add error handling
- [ ] Write tests
```

# Weekend Reflections

## What I'm Thinking About

Had an interesting conversation with mom about career choices. She made some good points about work-life balance that I hadn't really considered before.

The new project at work is challenging but exciting. I feel like I'm learning a lot, especially about system architecture and team leadership.

## Random Thoughts

- Need to call dentist about appointment
- Should probably start exercising more regularly
- Want to learn photography this year

## Ideas for Later

Maybe I should write a blog post about the technical challenges we solved last week. Could be helpful for other developers facing similar issues.

Also thinking about starting a side project - maybe something related to productivity tools for developers.

```

## Performance Testing

### Large File Test
- Create 100KB markdown file
- Test detection and aging performance
- Ensure processing completes within reasonable time

### Batch Performance Test
- Create directory with 100 small markdown files
- Test batch processing performance
- Verify memory usage stays reasonable

## Integration Testing

### End-to-End Workflow
1. Initialize configuration: `age config --init`
2. Detect document type: `age detect meeting-notes.md`
3. Age document: `age meeting-notes.md`
4. Check status: `age status`
5. Undo aging: `age --undo meeting-notes.md`
6. Verify restoration worked correctly

## Automated Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Document parser functionality
- Type detection algorithms
- Configuration loading
- Backup/restore operations

### Integration Tests
- Full command workflows
